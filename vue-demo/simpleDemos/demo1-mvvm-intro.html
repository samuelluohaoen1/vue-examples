<!--This is an extremely basic web page using Vue aimed at introducing
the idea of MVVM pattern and virtual DOM-->


<!--
The philosophy of Vue:

Vue strictly follows the idea of SoC (Separation of Concern). Therefore, it
is a pure presentation layer framework. To achieve data communication, we
often need the help of tools like Axios(Recommended) or jQuery.

In the ancient times, people write a monolith HTML webpage everything is
squeeze together and there is no such thing as design patterns.
Vue is designed so that a web page is entirely made up of "widgets".
These "widgets" are loosely coupled, highly configurable and reusable,
much alike the widgets on the Android/Apple home screen. These "widgets"
are officially namely components. There is a vivid picture of such an idea
on the Vue official documentation:
https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html

<!-- View  -->

<!-- 5. Create a tag to present data -->
<div id="app">
    <!-- Notice that now we are no longer simply evluating the variable `message`
     from the model layer. Now we are binding `message` in the View-Model layer
     of the MVVM pattern where if `message` is updated in the Model layer, the
     change is instantly reflected in the view layer. This is different from
     simply doing: `document.getElementById("app").innerText = "somethine else"`.
     The above operation needs DOM traversal which is very inefficient. This
     technique is called Virtual DOM. -->

    <!-- 6. Binding data -->
    {{ message }}
</div>

<h2 class="hoverMe">
    <!-- `v-bind` allows binding of data in attributes. -->
    <!-- Things like `v-bind` are called directives. v obviously
    stands for Vue. -->
    <!-- See that now we can dynamically change the attributes by
    changing the data bound!!! -->
    <span v-bind:title="messageForSpan">
        Hover mouse here to see data from the model layer.
    </span>

<!-- 1. Importing Vue -->
<!-- Note that this must be placed after the View layer else nothing works-->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.5.21/dist/vue.js"></script>
<script>
    // Model layer

    // 2. Instantiating a Vue object. `vm` is short for View Model
    var vm = new Vue({
        // 3. Specific the element where this Vue object is for
        el: "#app",

        // 4. Populate data
        data: {
            message: "Hello, Vue!",
        }
    });

    var vmm = new Vue({

        /* Note: Each Vue object can only bind to one specific tag.
           For example, if there are multiple tags in class `.hoverMe`,
           only the first occurrence will be bound. */
        el: ".hoverMe",

        data: {
            messageForSpan: "Hello, v-bind!"
        }
    });
