<div id="app">
    <!-- Notice that now we are no longer simply evluating the variable `message`
     from the model layer. Now we are binding `message` in the View-Model layer
     of the MVVM pattern where if `message` is updated in the Model layer, the
     change is instantly reflected in the view layer. This is different from
     simply doing: `document.getElementById("app").innerText = "somethine else"`.
     The above operation needs DOM traversal which is very inefficient. This
     technique is called Virtual DOM. -->

    <!-- 6. Binding data -->
    {{ message }}

    <!-- `v-bind` allows binding of data in attributes. -->
    <!-- Things like `v-bind` are called directives. v obviously
    stands for Vue. -->
    <!-- See that now we can dynamically change the attributes by
    changing the data bound!!! -->

        Hover mouse here to see data from the model layer.
