Ending thoughts on Vue components.
See that components in Vue are extremely robust. They are like the frontend "Java bean".
They enable high reuse of code, provide loose coupling among other components, also are
highly configurable and customizable. We have truly achieve "Frontend Engineering".

At this point, we can write some beautiful SPA (Single Page Application). But this
is far from enough. We still need to learn how to manage a huge frontend project
where there are many SPAs and other essential modules.

Read this FIRST:
Consider this use case requirement:
Now that we have a list, suppose we want to add an button to delete
each entry of our list. We certainly can do this using old DOM
traversal way. But how do we exploit Vue's 2-way bindings for this?
Meaning, somehow we want to delete the datum in the list of our
ViewModel layer, then the corresponding node in the View layer is
deleted automatically.

        5. Now, when we actually use the component we defined, we can bind the exposed callback interface
        with the logic provided by the ViewModel layer. In this case, `v-on:remove="remove_book(index)"`.
        This piece code simply translates to: "This component has a button and this button can be clicked.
        However, the exact event of what should happen when clicked is still undefined. Well, I am gonna
        have this button configured in a way so that when clicked, the data in my ViewModel layer is modified.
        Thus, I am defining `remove_book()` in my ViewModel layer where the data is stored, and bind it
        with the interface exposed by this component, namely `button_event`.
